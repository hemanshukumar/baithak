This website has been created as a bulletin board for creative output by interested people. Visitors are welcome to comment on the work shown here, and also hopefully, to contribute their own material! It seeks to encourage meaningful and fun interaction between people who belong to, or are interested in, South Asia and especially India and Pakistan. We try to engender a space for active dialoguing on all topics under the sun, so that we may appreciate each others' viewpoints and learn about our diverse cultures, while also just hanging out and enjoying ourselves.
